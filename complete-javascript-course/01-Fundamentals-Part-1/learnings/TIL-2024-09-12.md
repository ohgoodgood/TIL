# Variables and Values

## All values' type are either object or primitive.

## `undefined` vs `null`
- Whenever we declare an empty variable, the type and the value of the variable are both `undefined`.
- When there's a `null` value, the data type should be `null` as well. However, it's `object`. This is a bug, but not fixed with regard to legacy.

## `let` vs `const` vs `var`
- value reassign(or variable mutation) should be as less as possible, because it can create a potential for bugs.
- use `let` only when you're sure there will be any changes in value.
- about `var`, we'll talk later...
