## A variable is a box in which we can store a value.

## Once declared, a variable can be referenced over and over again.

## Code Convention in JS
1. for variable names, use `camelCase`.
2. don't start a variable name with an upper-case letter.
3. variable names with all upper-case are used for constants.
4. make sure all variable names are descriptive.

## Hard Rules for Variable names in JS
1. a variable name can't start with a number.
2. a variable name can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, or the dollor sign.
3. a variable name can't contain a reserved JS keyword.
